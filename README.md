# Arcade Center

Arcade Center is an early-stage project from the students of the Full Stack Web Development program at Business College Helsinki, developed during the spring of 2021.

It consist of a web portal with 3 single-player games (Cyclone Arcade, How fast are you? and Jackpot) and 1 multi-player game (Kimble). It allows to keep track of the player's score, game top scores, and to share the experience on social media.

The project was developed using agile software development methods (SCRUM) in approximately 3-5 full working days over the course of 2 weeks.
The project repository can be found on GitHub. The project integrated some game projects developed during the program courses under the guidance of Margit Tennosaar and Hoang Pham.
